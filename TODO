- Add ability to export daemonsets to file, so that users can add customizations(node selector, etc)
- Implement standalone mode:
  - Standalone mode should allow the image to be run on one node(with something like docker run, kubectl run)
  - Tests that require a target should receive a target from arguments of the run command. 
  - Standalone check shouldn't run bandwidth or port check by default, as those require something running on the other end.
  - Standalone mode primarily focuses on the connectivity test(ping) and host config tests
- refactor:
  - move all check specific logic so that it resides only within the check .go file
  - reduce complexity of logic, remove all redundant code
  - Test results shouldn't have their own separate output logic, make the output logic generic
- Check for proxies - system env var, containerd config??
- Compare MTU(host to host, and host to vxlan)
- Load average < numCPU
- Description on checks in results(what the expected results should be)
- Hostconfig - Add multiple interface warning
- Test ipv6
- Persistent run(run forever)?
- Capture hops in ping results
- Run against Rancher for all downstream clusters?
- Any specific port checks in pods?
- Default to cleanup=true
